# Prestige

A simple scene manager for [ebiten](https://ebitengine.org/)

---- 

`prestige` is heavily inspired by [stagehand](https://github.com/joelschutz/stagehand), but aims to simplify and clarify
some parts. It also comes with (way) fewer features, but should suffice, or be easily extendable, to accomodate other
use cases.
